# FinalProject
380 Subway Project

# Install
Clone the repository. You must build the included "WeatherHandler.java" as
"WeatherHandler.jar" and place it in the executables folder, alongside SubwaySimulator.jar

# Usage
While there is commandline args to set the city and country in question, it is recommended
to instead edit lines 20 and 21 in Program.java respectively to change this option.

# Known Issues
- Map doesn't line up
- there is a delay in between frames due to timers
- UI/UX looks bad
- TrainSim might not close properly on window close
